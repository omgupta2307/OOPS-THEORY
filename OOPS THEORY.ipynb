    "\n",
    "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "ANS:- Oject Oriented Programming is a way of writing code by using object.\n",
    "An object is like a mini program - it has data (called attributes) and action (called methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "ANS:- A class in Object-Oriented Programming is a blue print or template used to create objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "ANS:- An object is like a mini program - it has data (called attributes) and action (called methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "ANS:- Abstraction - Hiding unnecessary details, showing only what's needed.\n",
    "      Encapsulation - Hiding data inside the class to protect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "ANS:- Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special built in methods in python.\n",
    " They start and end with two underscores:\n",
    "  __like_this__\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
    "ANS:-Inheritance refers to the where a child class receives a properties and behavivors of a parent class .\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "ANS:-polymorphism allows same method name to do different things depending on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "ANS:- Encapsulation in python means hiding data inside a class and only allowing acess \n",
    "      through methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "ANS:- A constructor is a special method in python that automattically runs when you create an object from a class .\n",
    "      In python , the constructor is called __int__()\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "ANS:- Class Method - A class method is method that works with the class, not with a specific object.\n",
    "     It use @classmethod and take cls as he first level argument .\n",
    "     Static Method - A static method is just a normal function inside a class.\n",
    "    It uses @staticmethod and takes no self or cls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "ANS: Methods overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different \n",
    "     arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "ANS:- Method overriding means the child class has a method with the same name as the parent class ,\n",
    "      but it does something different .\n",
    "\n",
    "13.What is a property decorator in Python+\n",
    "ANS:- It allows method to be accessed as attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "ANS:- Polymorphism allows the same method name to work differently depending on the object .\n",
    "   It is usefule because:-\n",
    "    1 . Clean and reusable code\n",
    "    2. Flexiblity\n",
    "    3. Easy to extend\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "ANS:- AN abstract class is a class that cannot be used directly to create objects.\n",
    "      It is used as a base class and contains abstract methods that must be defined in child classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "ANS:- Advantage of OOP:-\n",
    " 1. MODULARITY\n",
    " 2.REUSABILITY\n",
    " 3.DATA PROTECTION\n",
    " 4.POLYMORPHISM\n",
    " 5.INHERITANCE\n",
    " 6.EAISER TO MAINTAIN AND UPDATE\n",
    " 7.REAL WORLD MAPPING\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "ANS:-Class variables are shared among all instances (objects) of a class, \n",
    "     while instance variables are unique to each individual instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
    "ANS:-Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
    "ANS:-In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special methods (dunder methods) that define how an object\n",
    "     is represented as a string. They serve different purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
    "ANS:- suppr() is used in a child class to call a method from its parents class .\n",
    "\n",
    "Q21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "ANS:- __delete__ is a special method used with descriptors in python .\n",
    "        It is called when you delete an attribute using del1 keyword. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
    "ANS:- Main difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python are:-\n",
    "      @classmethod work with class data (user cls)\n",
    "      @staticmethod a normal function inside a class (no cls or self)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
    "ANS:- Polymorphism with inheritance means: A child class gives a new version of method from the parent,\n",
    "      and python called calls the correct version based on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
    "ANS:- Method chaining lets you call multiple methods in one line by returning s e l f from each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
    "ANS:- The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
    "      if a class has a __call__() method,then you use the object like a function - with parentheses()."
